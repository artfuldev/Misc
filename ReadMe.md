##Description
After thinking about it a while, I finally got it. There are tons of small things we do, worth showing to the world that we do know how to do those things, but we can't showcase them as a big project. You know, like, single-file projects? Still, they need their own explanations and readme's.

So, here we go. Misc, a project repository which showcases my varied, small-but-significant projects.

##Projects

###ILIFO (Intelligent LIne FOllower)
####Learn.cpp
C++ code to do black box system identification for determining the mathematical model of an AI level 3 line follower using a 7-input, 6-output perceptron. Got the confidence to work on this after [TWILP](https://www.github.com/kenshinthebattosai/TWILP) was successful.

###Multi-Threading
####MTTest.java
My first attempt at trying out multi-threading in java. Using nested classes, and finding the minimum of a large array using multi-threading was indeed a fun project.

###Design and Simulation of a Robotic Hand
####Robotics Hand - Thumb.oxps
An XPS document containing the design of a robotic hand (simulated using Workspace 5 Demo). As Workspace 5 only allows for serial manipulators, a complete robotic hand having 5 fingers as 5 end-effectors could not be modelled, as it will be a parallel manipulator. Hence the design was stopped with the Robotic Hand having a thumb alone. It is plain to note that the other fingers may be modelled the same way.
